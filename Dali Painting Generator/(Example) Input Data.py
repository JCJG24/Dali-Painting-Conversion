# The actual loading of the data would typically be done using a library or function that reads the data from a file or a database and stores it in the declared variables.
# For example, if the data is stored in a CSV file, you could use the pandas library to load the data into a DataFrame and then extract the arrays you need to store in x_train, y_train, x_test, and y_test:

import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("path/to/data.csv")

# Split the data into training and testing sets
x_train = df[df["set"] == "train"]["inputs"].values
y_train = df[df["set"] == "train"]["labels"].values
x_test = df[df["set"] == "test"]["inputs"].values
y_test = df[df["set"] == "test"]["labels"].values


# To load image data for use in training and testing a machine learning model, you can use a library such as NumPy or OpenCV to read the images and convert them into arrays of numerical values.
# Here's an example using the OpenCV library:
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the training images
x_train = []
y_train = []
for i in range(number_of_training_images):
    image = cv2.imread(f'training_image_{i}.jpg')
    x_train.append(image)
    y_train.append(training_image_labels[i])

# Load the test images
x_test = []
y_test = []
for i in range(number_of_test_images):
    image = cv2.imread(f'test_image_{i}.jpg')
    x_test.append(image)
    y_test.append(test_image_labels[i])

# Convert the lists of images to NumPy arrays
x_train = np.array(x_train)
y_train = np.array(y_train)
x_test = np.array(x_test)
y_test = np.array(y_test)
